# 👨‍💻 Simple OOP Example – Person Class in C#

## 📌 Objective

This project demonstrates the basics of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in C# by creating a simple `Person` class with properties and methods.

## 📋 Requirements

- Define a class `Person` with the following:
  - Properties: `Name`, `Age`
  - Method: `Introduce()` to print a personalized greeting
- Instantiate multiple `Person` objects in the `Main` method
- Call the `Introduce()` method for each object

## 🧾 Features

- Demonstrates encapsulation and class-based design
- Uses object instantiation and method invocation
- Simple and beginner-friendly

## 💻 How It Works

1. A `Person` class is defined with `Name` and `Age` as properties.
2. The constructor initializes these properties.
3. The `Introduce()` method prints a friendly message with the person's name and age.
4. In the `Main` method, three `Person` objects are created and introduced.

## 🧮 Example Output

```
Hi, I'm Alice and I'm 25 years old.
Hi, I'm Bob and I'm 30 years old.
Hi, I'm Charlie and I'm 22 years old.
```
