## 📄 File I/O and Exception Handling in C#

### 🛠️ Objective
This C# console application demonstrates basic file input/output operations and exception handling. It reads data from a text file, processes it, and writes the result to another file.

---

### ✅ Features
- Reads content from a file (`data.txt`)
- Counts:
  - Number of lines
  - Number of characters
  - Number of words
  - Number of occurrences of the character `'e'`
- Writes results to `output.txt`
- Handles common file-related errors using `try-catch`

---

### 📁 Files
- **Program.cs** – The main C# code file.
- **data.txt** – Input file (you can create and add any sample text).
- **output.txt** – Output file generated by the program with analysis results.

---

### 🛡️ Exception Handling

The program safely handles:

- **FileNotFoundException** – If `data.txt` is missing.
- **IOException** – For other file-related issues (e.g., permission denied).
- **General exceptions** – To catch any unexpected errors.

---

### 📌 Sample Output (in `output.txt`)
```
No of lines      : 4
No of characters : 87
No of words      : 18
No of 'e' chars  : 7
```
